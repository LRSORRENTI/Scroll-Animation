        Interesting to note that we can use a CSS pseudo-selector to
        .box:nth-of-type(even){ transform: translateX(-400%);, so all of our
        even boxes will come in from one side, and all of our odd boxes from the
        other }

        Now we also want to remove the horizontal scroll bar so we can remove it
        by adding 'overflow-x: hidden' to our body selector in our stylesheet

        We could use jquery for something like this, or a library like 'animate
        on scroll', animate on scroll is a cool library as well, I just checked
        it out

        But this above is very lightweight, and it's simple to do
